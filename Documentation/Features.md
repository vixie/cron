## Environment Variables

These can be set on a per CronTab basis.

<br>

### Syntax

```env
SHELL = /bin/sh
PATH = .:/bin:/usr/bin
Test = 'This is a test'
Hello = "World"
Values = With Spaces
```

<br>

### Variables

*with special meanings.*

<br>

#### $\huge\texttt{\textcolor{SkyBlue}{LOGNAME}}$

<pre>
Defaults to data in the users `passwd` entry
</pre>

<br>

#### $\huge\texttt{\textcolor{LimeGreen}{MAILTO}}$

<pre>
If set, will mail the output of Cron to
the user with the specified login name
<br>
Useful if you decide to use BINMAIL in `cron.h`
as it doesn't know anything about aliasing
</pre>

<br>

#### $\huge\texttt{\textcolor{SkyBlue}{SHELL}}$

<pre>
Defaults to `/bin/sh`
</pre>

<br>

#### $\huge\texttt{\textcolor{LimeGreen}{USER}}$

<pre>
Read from the users `passwd`
entry and cannot be changed
</pre>

<br>

#### $\huge\texttt{\textcolor{SkyBlue}{HOME}}$

<pre>
Defaults to data in the users `passwd` entry
</pre>

<br>

#### $\huge\texttt{\textcolor{LimeGreen}{PATH}}$

<pre>
Contains the systems paths
</pre>

<br>

#### $\huge\texttt{\textcolor{SkyBlue}{TZ}}$

<pre>
Can be set, but ignored other
than for the command it runs
</pre>

## Weekdays

can be specified with their first  `3`  
letters in whatever case you prefer.

<kbd>  $\huge\texttt{\textcolor{Month-F}{Dec}}$  </kbd>  

<br>
<br>

## Mixing

Unlike standard Cron, ranges & lists can be mixed.

```
1,3-5
```

<br>
<br>

## Stepping

Ranges can specify a value to step width.

```
10-16/2  ≍  10,12,14,16
10-16/3  ≍  10,13,16
```

<br>
<br>

## Sunday

The day can be specified with both  `0`  and  `7`  
which **BSD** and **ATT** apparently disagree about.

<br>
<br>

## User

Every user has their own CronTab config,  
as it is also done in **System V**'s Cron flavor.

<br>

### BSD 4.2

In this version of BSD, only the root  
user could have a CronTab config.

<br>

### BSD 4.3

- The **CronTab** format was made incompatible.

- Non-root UIDs could run the command.

- Only root could edit the **CronTab** file.

<br>
<br>

## System V

The  `crontab`  command is loosely compatible with  
**System V**, but has been extended with more options.

Running the command without arguments  
shows a summary on how to use of the it.

[<img height = 1500 width = 24% align = left  src = '../Resources/Space.svg' >][#]
[<img height = 1500 width = 24% align = right src = '../Resources/Space.svg' >][#]

<br>
<br>

## Comments

- Must be on a line by themselves

- Can have leading whitespace

- `#`  starts the comment

<br>
<br>

## Auto Reloading

If the  `crontab`  command makes any changes,  
the Cron daemon will reload all tables before the  
next iteration automatically.

<br>

### Other Crons

-   May require you have to kill and restart the daemon.

-   May unnecessarily read & parse the config continuously.

<br>
<br>

## Access

The **CronTab** files cannot be read nor modified other  
than with the  `crontab`  /  `cron`  commands, this is  
to allow for automatic reloading.

This shouldn't pose a problem however, as  `crontab`  
allows you to adjust everything in your own **CronTab**.

With root you can of course access anyone's **CronTab**.

<br>
<br>

## MailTo

Any output generated by commands to  `stdout`  and  
`stderr`  will be mailed to the owner of the **CronTab**.

Alternatively the  `MAILTO`  variable is used.  
⤷ Check the **[Environment Variable]** section.

<br>

### Header

The email messages header will include:

-   The command that was run by Cron

-   The list of passed environment variables of  
    which the following will always be present:

    `SHELL`    `HOME`    `USER`    `LOGNAME`

    *LogName is only passed on System V*
    
<br>
<br>

[<img height = 1000 width = 24% align = left  src = '../Resources/Space.svg' >][#]
[<img height = 1000 width = 24% align = right src = '../Resources/Space.svg' >][#]

## DOM / DOW

The situation is odd.  

<br>

`* * 1,15 * Sun`  will run on:

1st  |  15th  |  Sundays

<br>

`* * * * Sun`  will *only* run on:

Sundays

<br>

`* * 1,15 * *`  will *only* run on:

1st  |  15th

<br>

This is why we keep  `e -> dow_star`  &  `e -> dom_star`

I didn't think up this behavior, it's how **Cron**  
has always worked but the documentation  
hasn't been very clear.

I have been told that some **AT&T Crons** do not  
act this way and do the more reasonable thing,  
which is - in my honest opinion - to  `or`  the  
various field - matches together.  

In that sense this **Cron** isn't completely  
similar to some of the **AT&T Crons** .
