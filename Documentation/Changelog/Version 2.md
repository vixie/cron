## Version 1 âŸ· 2

<kbd>â€…â€…1988 | February 8thâ€…â€…</kbd>

<br>

Many changes were made in a rash of activity  
about six months ago, the exact list of which  
is no longer that clear in my memory.

I know that version 1 used a file calledâ€…â€…`POKECRON` ,  
in theâ€…â€…`/usr/spool/cron`â€…â€…directory, to tell if it was  
time to re-read all CronTab configs.

Version 2 uses the modification time of config  
files in the CronTab directory, where it re-reads  
those files whose modification time has changed.

Note that the crontab (1) command will do aâ€…â€…`utimes`â€…â€…call to  
check if the modification time of the directory has changed.

This is done since the filename / inode will often remain  
the same after a replacement and the modification time  
wouldn't change in that case.

<br>

**Toerless Eckert** gave me the idea to increase the  
environment variable string limit to fix problems  
some people had with theirâ€…â€…`PATH`â€…â€…files.

`100`â€„â€„ðŸ –â€„â€„`1000`

### <kbd>â€…â€…1988 | February 16thâ€…â€…</kbd>

<br>

-   Movedâ€„â€„`/usr/spool/cron/crontabs`  
    toâ€„â€„`/usr/lib/cron/tabs`

    <br>

-   Addedâ€„â€„`allow`â€„â€„/â€„â€„`deny`

	â¤·â€„â€„`/usr/lib/cron/{allow,deny}`
	
	â¤·â€„â€„Since the **System V** naming for this depends onâ€„â€„`at`  
    â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„using the same directory, which would be stupid.
	
    <br>
    
	*Hint, useâ€„â€„`/usr/{lib,spool}/at`*

<br>

### <kbd>â€…â€…1988 | February 22ndâ€…â€…</kbd>

<br>

Useâ€„â€„`getpwent()`â€„â€„to readâ€„â€„`passwds`  
and try to open each CronTab config.

â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„â€„ðŸ —

Read the `spool` directory for crontabs <br>
& look each one up using `getpwnam()`

<br>

### <kbd>â€…â€…1988 | December 9thâ€…â€…</kbd>

<br>

-   Now syncs toâ€„â€„`00`â€„â€„after every minute

	â¤· Makes **Cron** predictable.
	
    <br>
    
-   Added logging toâ€„â€„`/var/cron/log`

<br>

### <kbd>â€…â€…1990 | April 14thâ€…â€…</kbd>

<br>

*Changes since December 1989*

-   Fixed a number of bugs reported by **John Gilmore**.

-   Addedâ€„â€„`syslog`â€„â€„as per **Keith Bostic**.

-   Added security features:

	Commands can only be run by, the owner <br>
	of / with write permission to, the crontab.

	*Not working well yet*
